# CodeLlama Notes

- *Model*: Meta's CodeLlama (7B, 13B, 34B variants)
- *Type*: LLaMA-based code-specialized large language model
- *Focus*: Code generation and explanation

## Strengths
- Strong at *generating explanations and questions*
- Can be *prompt-engineered* to guide students instead of solving directly
- Trained on large datasets of code

## Weaknesses
- *Resource intensive* (needs GPUs for larger models)
- Tendency to provide *full solutions* unless carefully controlled

## Use Case for Competence Analysis
- Effective at *reframing student errors into reflective prompts*
- Promising tool for *encouraging deeper learning*
